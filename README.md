# Portfolio-2.0

This is my portfolio website, built using **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Appwrite**. The website showcases my personal and professional details, including:

- **Basic Information**: My name, educational background, and contact information.
- **Professional Details**: My skills, projects.

It is a **full-stack** application where I utilize **Appwrite** as the backend service. I developed an **Admin Panel** for managing and updating the dynamic content on my portfolio website, allowing for easy customization and content management.

For animations, I have integrated **Framer Motion**, which adds smooth transitions and interactive effects throughout the site.
